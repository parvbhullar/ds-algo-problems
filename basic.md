> Data structure and Algo
> Principles of database systems
> Principles of operating systems
> You have a client-server architecture. In between client and server you have your application. Given each server has a success probability factor `x`(0 to 1), You are supposed to come up with a logic so that you decide which server among all the active servers would process your request and give back the response to your application, which in turn is displayed to the user. Design and Develop your application logic after that.  
> Given a service running on a set of servers, each with an initial % success factor, design a load-balancer. Design the same load-balancer for the case when the success factor can change dynamically over a period of time. You have to write the code for both the parts and make a functional demo. The demo can have any interface (CLI/webapp). 
> Run time - time complexity

https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Interview/Swiggy-Engineering-Manager-Interview-Questions-EI_IE952680.0,6_KO7,26.htm?countryRedirect=true

Glassdoor - https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Interview/Google-Interview-Questions-E9079.htm

The syllabus for the interviews is very clear and simple: 
1) Dynamic Programming
2) Super recursion (permutation, combination,...2^n, m^n, n!...etc. type of program. (NP hard, NP programs)
3) Probability related programs
4) Graphs: BFS/DFS are usually enough
5) All basic data structures from Arrays/Lists to circular queues, BSTs, Hash tables, B-Trees, and Red-Black trees, and all basic algorithms like sorting, binary search, median,...
6) Problem solving ability at a level similar to TopCoder Division 1, 250 points. If you can consistently solve these, then you are almost sure to get in with 2-weeks brush up.
7) Review all old interview questions in Glassdoor to get a feel. If you can solve 95% of them at home (including coding them up quickly and testing them out in a debugger + editor setup), you are in good shape.
8) Practice coding--write often and write a lot. If you can think of a solution, you should be able to code it easily...without much thought.
9) Very good to have for design interview: distributed systems knowledge and practical experience.
10) Good understanding of basic discrete math, computer architecture, basic math.
11) Coursera courses and assignments give a lot of what you need to know.
12) Note that all the above except the first 2 are useful in "real life" programming too! 
Interview 1: Graph related question and super recursion 
Interview 2: Design discussion involving a distributed system with writes/reads going on at different sites in parallel. 
Interview 3:
Array and Tree related questions 
Interview 4: Designing a simple class to do something. Not hard, but not easy either. You need to know basic data structures very well to consider different designs and trade-offs. 
Interview 5:
Dynamic programming,
Computer architecture and low level perf. enhancement question which requires knowledge of Trees, binary search, etc. 
At the end, I wasn't tired and rather enjoyed the discussions. I think the key was long term preparation and time spent doing topcoder for several years (on and off as I enjoy solving the problems). 
Conclusion: "It's not the best who win the race; it's the best prepared who win it."

  Software Interview Questions

1. There are n ticket windows in the railway station, ith window has ai tickets available. Price of a ticket is equal to the number of tickets remaining in that window at that time. When m tickets have been sold, whats the maximum amount of money the railway station can earn?
e.g.
INPUT: n=2, m=4
a1=2 , a2=5
OUTPUT: 14(2nd window sold 4 tickets so 5+4+3+2).

2. You are given a 2-D matrix with M rows and N columns.You are initially positioned at (0,0) which is the top-left cell in the array. You are allowed to move either right or downwards. The array is filled with 1s and 0s. A 1 indicates that you can move through that cell, a 0 indicates that you cannot move through that cell. Return the number of paths from top-left cell to bottom-right cell.(i.e. (0,0)to(M-1,N-1)). 
Since answer can be large thus you have to return ans%(10^9+7).

Constraints: Best time and space complexity were required to cover all the test cases for both questions.

INTERVIEW ROUNDS:

Round 1 (40 mins Skype):
One coding question to be done on shared screen.
1. Given a string of characters , parse the numeric values in it ,add all of them and return the result.
Lot of discussion regarding the various test cases around this question(e.g, handing of -ve numbers , decimals , overflow etc).
Main concentration was just to get as many as test cases possible and an efficient solution as well.
And Some common question like why you coding in C++? Advantages of OOP?

Round 2 (45 mins Skype):
Again one coding question to be done on shared screen.
1. Given an array of positive integers, find all possible triangle triplets that can be formed from this array.
eg: 9 8 10 7
ans: 9 8 10, 9 8 7, 9 10 7, 7 8 10
Note : array not sorted, there is no limit on the array length.

Again the main concentration was to work around all possible test cases and an efficient solution as well.

Round 3 (50 mins Skype):

Design round basically :
Design a complete system for Traffic enforcement camera (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_enforcement_camera).
He asked to tell as many as test cases possible for the scenario. I managed somehow to 15-20, later he told there can be many more viz. weather conditions, fog etc.
what type of testings should be performed on this system?
Then by going through my resume, he asked details from my first project as it was related to Image processing then some basic stuff about system calls and Unix commands.
Then some other question :
1) Do you know about any software testing framework? (like Selenium)
2) What is the best protocol to store images?
3) How JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) works?
4) which database to use and when ? (he was try to ask about NOSQL databases).

Round 4 (40 mins Telephonic HR+Tech):

This round was with the hiring manager from their head office. He just started with the basic introduction. Asked my area of interest. Then questions accordingly.
Like:
1) One liner command to kill all process in the system which were using JAVA?
2) Difference between TOP and PS commands? why TOP is called TOP?
3) Explain XSS attacks and how to prevent it? and the same for sqli? Any experience with them?
4) Algorithmic : http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-repeating-and-a-missing-number/ gives as many solutions you can? Then ..tell about their time and space complexity?
5) Explain your final year project?
6) Why should I hire you , not others?
7) Experiences with automated and manual testings ?
Then he asked me if I had any questions, I asked some company stuff. Thats all !! Hope that helps. Best of luck.



First round mostly comprised of problems on OS, DS, Basic Aptitude, Algorithms etc.
2 coding questions
1. Given a string find the first non repeating character in it
2. Given an array of integers, find count of minimum number of elements to be removed from the array such that the maximum element of the new array is at most twice of the minimum.

39 shortlisted after this round

Round 2(F2F)
He asked about my favorite subjects and Data Structures that I have implemented. I named few Data Structures including Segment Tree. Then he asked me about segment trees and how to solve some simple problems based on segment trees, He asked only about approach didnt asked me to code. Then he asked me about

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level/

I told him approach using level order traversal. Then he asked me to connect nodes on same level but this time to their left sibling. After telling my approach he asked me to code and said that he want code free of any errors. After I gave him my code he pointed out that there are some errors in code. He asked me to find and correct them myself.
Then he asked another question:

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/diameter-of-a-binary-tree/

After hearing my approach for this question he asked me to print leaves that correspond to diameter.

Round 3(F2F)
Only one question was asked in this round. She asked me to implement a data structure that can perform
1) Insert (O(1))
2) Delete (O(1))
3) Count(O(1))
4) Get Element(O(1))
on integer inputs. Here Get Element returns any element present in DS.

I told her my approaches using array, single linked list with hashing and using two singly linked list and hashing. I couldnt reach exact solution but she was satisfied with my approach.

Solution to this problem was easy using doubly linked list and hashing.

After this round a total of 19 students were selected for internship.

* We can trap "3*2 units" of water between 3 an 2,
* "1 unit" on top of bar 2 and "3 units" between 2 
* and 4.  See below diagram also.
*  
* Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
* Output: 6

* Trap "1 unit" between first 1 and 2, "4 units" between
* first 2 and 3 and "1 unit" between second last 1 and last 2
* Given two strings str1 and str2 and below operations that can performed on str1. Find minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert ‘str1’ into ‘str2’.
Insert
Remove
Replace
All of the above operations are of equal cost.
* Examples:
* Input:   str1 = "geek", str2 = "gesek"
* Output:  1
* We can convert str1 into str2 by inserting a 's'.
* Input:   str1 = "cat", str2 = "cut"
* Output:  1
* We can convert str1 into str2 by replacing 'a' with 'u'.
* Input:   str1 = "sunday", str2 = "saturday"
* Output:  3
* Last three and first characters are same.  We basically
* need to convert "un" to "atur".  This can be done using
* below three operations. 
* Replace 'n' with 'r', insert t, insert a
* Given a string with repeated characters, task is rearrange characters in a string so that no two adjacent characters are same.
Note : It may be assumed that the string has only lowercase English alphabets.
* Examples: 
Input: aaabc 
Output: abaca 
Input: aaabb
Output: ababa 
Input: aa 
Output: Not Possible
Input: aaaabc 
Output: Not Possible
* This problem is know as Clock angle problem where we need to find angle between hands of an analog clock at a given time.
    * Examples:Input:  h = 12:00, m = 30.00
* Output: 165 degreeInput:  h = 3.00, m = 30.00 Output: 75 degree
